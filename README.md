## Summary

Since Microsoft has not released any official logos for their new technology .NET Core, we've decided to design our own, Microsoft style, and share them with the world.

We think they look like the logo Microsoft itself would have designed.

We're giving away the designs in a lot of different formats for you to use.

We have logos for **.NET Core**:

**ASP.NET Core**:

**ASP.NET Core MVC**:

and **Entity Framework Core**:
